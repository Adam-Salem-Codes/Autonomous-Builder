> # Autonomous-Builder

---

## Info 💻:
Autonomous-Builder is a Java project that helps people create
an Autonomous program for vEx v5 Robots also it generates C++ based on 
the user input through buttons. Unfortunately this is an unfinished
project and I would not recommend using it. But luckly if you
want to you can improve it if you want and make it better.

## Known Bugs[^1] 🐜:
The buttons on the UI don't show up immediately you will need
to hover over the buttons before they show.

or bugs.
