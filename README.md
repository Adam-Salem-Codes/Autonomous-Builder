> # Autonomous-Builder

---


## Known Bugs[^1] üêú:
The buttons on the UI don't show up immediately you will need
to hover over the buttons before they show. Another bug rarely
after using the program the program incorrectly saves the information
as "}}". Another one is that if /build directory doesn't exist the program
turns black and doesn't work at all.

## Info üíª[^2]:
Autonomous-Builder is a Java project that helps people create
an Autonomous program for vEx v5 Robots also it generates C++ based on 
the user input through buttons. Unfortunately this is an unfinished
project and I would not recommend using it. But luckly if you
want to you can improve it if you want and make it better.
